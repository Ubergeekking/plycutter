# Gallery format

A single directory for each "project".

A ``index.md`` file in the directory explaining what it is. (Link this
into the main ``mkdocs.yml`` file in the gallery section).

A header, explaining what it is and what it is made of.
Use an ``<img>`` tag with ``align="right"`` to show 

Some pictures. Use ``<img>`` tags. 

An ``.stl`` file is optional.

Other source files (e.g. OpenSCAD, Fusion 360, ...) are optional.

TODO: STL visualizaton; figure out an automatic build of all projects
with latest plycutter plus visualization of the resulting sheet model.
